# Predict_Turnover_using_AR-Net
An Application of AR-Net on Turnover time-series Dataset

# Background
AR-Net is a simple auto-regressive Neural Network for time-series (link to paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.12436).

# Install
1. Go to the developer's repository (link to repository: https://github.com/ourownstory/AR-Net/blob/master/README.md#ar-net) 
2. After downloading the code repository (via git clone), change to the repository directory (cd AR-Net) and install arnet as python package with pip install .

# Application
View the notebook example_notebooks/arnet_bakery_turnover.ipynb for an example on applying the AR-Net model to Predict Bakery Turnover.
